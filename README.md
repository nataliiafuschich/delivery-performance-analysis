# Delivery Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes delivery service performance using SQL and Google Sheets.  
The goal was to identify key factors affecting delivery success, delays, and operational efficiency.

The analysis includes data exploration, performance metrics calculation, and dashboard creation to support data-driven decision-making.

## Tools Used
- SQL (BigQuery)
- Google Sheets
- Pivot Tables
- Data Visualization
- Data Analysis

## Project Structure
- `queries.sql` — SQL queries used for data extraction and analysis  
- `delivery_dashboard.pdf` — dashboard with key metrics, pivot tables, and insights  

## Key Analysis Areas
The project focuses on analyzing:
- Delivery success and cancellation rates  
- Late delivery patterns  
- Performance by region  
- Performance by vehicle type  
- Impact of weather conditions on delivery outcomes  
- Delivery cost analysis  
- Cost per kilometer analysis  
- Delivery speed comparison 

## Key Insights
The analysis helped identify:
- Regions with the highest number of late and cancelled deliveries  
- Vehicle types associated with higher delay rates  
- Weather conditions impacting delivery performance  
- Cost efficiency differences across delivery conditions  
- Operational patterns affecting delivery success  

## Dashboard
The dashboard includes:
- Pivot tables with aggregated delivery metrics  
- Delivery performance KPIs  
- Cost analysis  
- Delivery success and delay distribution
